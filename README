SeleniumRunner is an experimental implementation of a multithreading
testing framework that runs prepared tests against a set of selenium-
enabled machines.

The aim of this project is to provide the user with a high level of
test combination and customization while keeping test round-trip times
low.

The secondary goal of this project is to provide a scriptable command
line interface (CLI) that can be used in automation processes to
determine the availability of a website and its features.

SeleniumRunner is currently being developped using Java and the
Selenium WebDriver API.

SeleniumRunner's current status is "work in progress".
