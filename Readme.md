Selina is an experimental implementation of a multithreading testing
framework that runs prepared tests against a set of selenium-enabled
machines.

The aim of this project is to provide the user with a high level of
test combination and customization while keeping test round-trip times
low.

The secondary goal of this project is to provide a scriptable command
line interface (CLI) that can be used in automation processes to
determine the availability of a website and its features.

Selina is currently being developped using Java and the Selenium
WebDriver API.

Selina's current status is "work in progress".
